    <p>In my spare time, I like to work on puzzles! Some of my favorite are math ones, as I strongly believe that they build problem solving skills that can transcend any field.</p>

    <p>Another thing i like to do, is spend an hour at the gym. I like to lift weights, and after that hour, I feel very refreshed and accomplished. Its a perfect way to end the day. </p>

    <p>Although I have not had much time, I like to play video games on my computer. I'm a big fan of the games "Assassin's Creed," partly to their historical influence.</p>
